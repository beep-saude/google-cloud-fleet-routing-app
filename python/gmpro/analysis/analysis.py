  Attributes:
    all_parking_tags: The set of all parking location tags that are visited in
      the solution. Note that parking locations that are not visited by any
      vehicle do not appear in the solution and by consequence, do not appear in
      this set.
    num_visits_to_parking: The number of times each parking is visited.
    vehicles_by_parking: For each parking tag, contains a mapping from vehicle
      indices to the list of indices of the visits made by this vehicle in
      global_visits.
    consecutive_visits: The per-vehicle list of consecutive visits to a parking
      location. The key of the mapping is the vehicle index, values are lists of
      visits to a parking location. Each element of this list is a pair
      (parking_tag, visit_index) such that
      `global_visits[vehicle_index][visit_index]` is the visit that generated
      the entry.
    non_consecutive_visits: The per-vehicle list of non-consecutive visits to a
      parking location. The format is the same as for consecutive_visits.
    shipments_by_parking: The list of parking location visits, indexed by the
      parking tag. The value is a list of lists of shipment indices. Each
      element of the outer list corresponds to one visit to the parking location
      and the elements of the inner list are the shipments delivered during this
      visit.
    global_visits: The list of visits from the global model, i.e. visits made by
      the vehicle while driving. The keys of the mapping are vehicle indices,
      the values are the list of global visit for each vehicle. Each visit is
      represented as a triple `(parking_tag, arrival_visit, departure_visit)`.
      When the global visit is a shipment delivered directly, `parking_tag` is
      `None`, and `arrival_visit` and `departure_visit` are both the index of
      the visit in the route. When the global visit is a sequence of deliveries
      through a parking location, then `parking_tag` is the tag of the parking
      location, `arrival_visit` is the index of the visit to the "arrival to
      parking" virtual shipment, and `departure_visit` is the index of the visit
      to the "departure from parking" virtual shipment. When there are multiple
      visits to the same parking location (a "parking ping-pong"), each delivery
      round has its own entry in the list.
    num_all_visits_to_parking: The number of times any parking location in the
      solution is visited.

  A "parking sandwich" is the situation where the vehicle visits a parking
  location A, then leaves it for other parking location B or a direct delivery,
  and only then comes back to parking A for another round of deliveries. This
  behavior is generally not desired, because it is confusing for the drivers.
  However, some parking sandwiches are unavoidable, because of delivery time
  windows. For example, when there are shipments with a morning delivery time
  window and shipments with an evening delivery time window, it is acceptable
  that the vehicle performs other shipments between these two time windows.

  This function computes the total number of sandwiches on the route, and
  estimates the number of "undesirable" cases when there is no time window
  forcing the driver to leave the parking and return to it later. In models with
  more complex constraints, it is very difficult to determine whether a sandwich
  is necessary or not.

  In this function, we estimate the undesirable ones purely on the basis of time
  windows of the shipments from the parking, for simplicity. We do this by
  looking at the latest end of a time window in the earlier visit to the
  parking, and at the earliest start of a time window in the later visit to the
  parking, and compare the two. If we see an overlap, we consider this the case
  of "bad" sandwich.

  However, note that the result is an approximation and there may be other
  reasons that lead to a parking sandwich, including time windows on other
  shipments (shipments delivered from other parking locations) or break requests
  of the vehicle, and finding an explanation for a certain parking sandwich may
  be very difficult.
