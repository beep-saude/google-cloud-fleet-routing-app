"""Implements a basic two-step route optimization algorithm on top of CFR.

Takes a Cloud Fleet Routing (CFR) request augmented with parking location data,
and creates a response that uses the given parking locations for deliveries.

Technically, the optimization is done by decomposing the original request into
a sequence of requests that solve parts of the optimization problem, and then
recombining them into full routes that include both driving and walking
directions.

On a high level, the solver does the following:
1. For each parking location, compute optimized routes for shipments that are
   delivered from this parking location. These routes start at the parking
   location and visit one or more final delivery locations. Additional
   constraints may be used to limit the length of these local routes.

   These optimized routes are used in two ways:
     - they provide an estimation of the time necessary to serve each parking
       location; this estimate is used in the global plan.
     - they are included in the final routes.

2. Based on the results from step 1, compute optimized routes that connect the
   parking locations and shipments that are delivered directly to the customer
   location (i.e. they are not delivered through a parking location).

   All shipments that are delivered through a parking location are represented
   by one (or more) "virtual" shipments that represent the parking location and
   its shipments. This shipment has has the waypoint of the parking location
   and the visit duration is equivalent to the time needed to deliver the
   shipments from the parking location.

3. The results from both plans are merged into a final plan that includes both
   directions for "driving" from the depots to the parking locations (and to
   custommer sites that are not served from a parking locatio) and directions
   for "walking" from the parking location to the final delivery locations.

   This plan contains all shipments from the original request, and pairs of
   "virtual" shipments that represent arrivals to and departures from parking
   locations.

    The refinement is done by re-optimizing the local (walking/biking) routes
    whenever there is a sequence of consecutive visits to the same parking
    location. This re-optimization is done on visits from all visits to the
    parking location in the sequence, so that the solver can reorganize how the
    local delivery rounds are done.

    This phase is different from the original local model in the sense that it:
      - always uses the original visit time windows for the visits in the plan,
      - uses a pickup & delivery model with a single vehicle and capacities to
        make sure that the result is a sequence of delivery rounds.
      - uses the original delivery rounds as an injected initial solution, so
        the refined solution should always have the same or better cost.

    Outline of the design of the model:
      - Each shipment is represented as a pickup (at the parking location) and a
        delivery (at the delivery address). If the original shipment had a time
        window constraint, the new shipment will have the same time window on
        the delivery request. All shipments are mandatory.
      - There is a single vehicle with capacity constraints corresponding to the
        capacity constraints for delivery from this parking location. The
        vehicle start and end time are flexible, but they are restricted to the
        start/end time of the sequence of visits to the parking location in the
        original solution.
      - The capacity constraint makes the "vehicle" return to the parking
        location when there are more shipments than can be delivered in one
        round. At the same time, by using a single vehicle, we make sure that
        the delivery rounds that we get out of the optimization can be executed
        by one driver in a sequence.
      - The model minimizes the total time and the total distance. Compared to
        the base local model, the cost per km and cost per hour are the same,
        but there is an additional steep cost for using more time than the
        solution of the base local model.

    Args:
      local_response: The original solution of the "local" part of the model.
      global_response: The original solution of the "global" part of the model.

    Returns:
      A new CFR request that models the refinement of local routes based on the
      solution of the global model.

    """Integrates a refined local plan into the base local and global models.

    Takes the base local and global requests and responses, and a response to a
    local refinement model, and creates:

    1. an integrated local request and response; the local model is created by
      replacing the refined parts of the base local model with the refinement.
      The integrated local model covers all shipments delivered from a parking
      location, and can be used as a local model with
      Planner.merge_local_and_global_result.
    2. an integrated global request; the global request is similar to the base
      global request, but it is based on the integrated local model rather than
      on the base local model.
    3. a first solution hint for the integrated global request; this first
      solution is created from the solution of the base global model by
      replacing the refined parts.
    4. an optional integrated global response. This response is created by
      reusing the routes in the previous global model, accounting for the
      refined local routes. Any time saved by the local refinement is
      transformed into wait time in the global model.
      This approach always yields a feasible solution because the local
      refinement either preserves the duration of the delivery rounds or makes
      them shorter. The result may, however, contain trivial inefficiencies
      because of the wait time used as padding.
      The full response is returned only when integration_mode is
      IntegrationMode.FULL_ROUTE; otherwise, it is None.

    When the integrated global response is not requested, it needs to be
    re-solved via CFR to (1) update arrival and departure times in the solution,
    (2) inject road traffic information if requested, and (3) use any time saved
    by the refinement to deliver more shipments.

    The solution of the integrated global model can be used together with the
    solution of the integrated local model to obtain a merged request+response
    via `Planner.merge_local_and_global_result()`.

    Args:
      local_request: A local request created by `self.make_local_request()`.
      local_response: A solution for `local_request`.

      refinement_response: A solution for a request created by
        `self.make_local_refinement_request(local_response, global_response)`.
      integration_mode: Determines the level of integration of the local
        solution into the global refinement request injected first solution.

    Returns:
      A tuple `(integrated_local_request, integrated_local_response,

    The merged request and response incorporate both the global "driving" routes

    The merged request uses the same shipments as the original request, extended
    with "virtual" shipments used to represent parking location arrivals and
    departures in the merged routes.

    Each parking location visit from the global plan is replaced by a visit to
    a virtual shipment that represents the arrival to the parking location, then
    all shipments delivered from the parking location, and then another virtual
    shipment that represents the departure from the parking location. The
    virtual shipments use the waypoint of the parking location as their
    position; the actual shipments delivered through the parking location and
    transitions between them are taken from the local plan.

    The request and the response follow the same structure as standard CFR JSON
    requests, but they do not use all fields, and sending the merged request to
    the CFR API endpoint would not produce the merged response. The pair can
