"""Defines transformation functions for break requests.

Defines a mini-language for flexible editing of breaks that allows quick
experimentation by doing the most common transformations in a few lines of code:
- The editing is done using a list of transformation rules that are executed in
  sequence.
- Each rule has a matcher part and an action part. The action part is executed
  only on time windows where the matcher part matches.
- The rules are applied recursively/can be chained; later rules are applied to
  the results of the previous rules.

The grammar of the language:
- Rules are separated by semicolons.
- Each rule contains one or more component; components are separated by
  whitespace.
- Each component has the format `{name}[{op}{value}]` where {name} is the name
  of a selector or an action, {op} is an operator (e.g. `=`), and {value} is an
  operand of the component. For some actions and selectors,the {op}{value} part
  is optional.
  - {name} is an identifier using alphanumeric characters, underscores, and '@'.
  - {operator} can be '=', '~='.
  - {value} can be either a string of non-whitespace characters, a double-quoted
    string (with json-style escaping) or a JSON object. Each selector or action
    may accept only some kinds of values.
  - Selector names start with `@`.

Examples:
- `minDuration=7200s`: sets the duration of all break requests to 7200s.
- `@time=16:00:00 delete`: deletes all breaks that can start at 16:00:00.
- `new earliestStartTime=17:00:00 latestStartTime=18:00:00 minDuration=60s`:
  adds a new break request that starts at 17:00, ends at 18:00, and has a
  minimal duration of 60s. The actual break request will use the dates from
  the global start/end time.

Supported selectors:
- `@time={time}`: selects break rules that can start at the given _time_ (not
  datetime), i.e. {time} is a time that is between `earliestStartTime` and
  `latestStartTime` on any date. When there are less than 24 hours between the
  earliest and the latest start times, this works as expected; otherwise, it
  always selects.
- `@vehicleLabel={label}`: selects break rules that belong to a vehicle with the
  given label (exact match).
- `@vehicleLabel~={regex}`: selects break rules that belong to a vehicle with a
  label that matches {regex} (a Python regular expression).
- `@vehicleWorkTime={time}`: selects break rules that belong to a vehicle that
  can work at the given time.

Supported actions:
- `delete`: deletes the break rule.
- `new`: Instead of editing the existing break rule, creates a new one and edits
  only that one. When a selector is used with new, the new break request is
  added only to vehicles that have a break request matching the selector.
- `location={waypoint}`: Transforms the break into a virtual shipment that makes
  the vehicle go to the given waypoint. The parameters of the shipment are set
  up so that there is a single visit whose start time window and duration
  correspond to the break request at the moment this action was executed. Once
  this action is used, no other actions apply to the affected break rule.
- `virtualShipmentLabel={label}`: When a virtual shipment is created for the
  break, {label} is used as a base of the label of this virtual shipment. The
  full label will include also the vehicle index and the vehicle label. When not
  specified, the default is "break".
- `depot`: Transforms the break into a virtual shipment that makes the vehicle
  return to the depot for the break. Equivalent to using `location={waypoint}`
  with {waypoint} being the start waypoint of the vehicle.
- `earliestStartTime={time}`, `latestStartTime={time}`: Changes the earliest or
  the latest start time of the break request. Similar to `@time`, the action
  takes only _time_ (not datetime) and infers the date from the existing value
  or from the global start/end date.
- `minDuration={duration}`: Changes the minimal duration of the break to
  {minDuration}.

The mini-language is intended to be used through the command-line flags of the
request transformation script `transform_request.py`.

  This function can be used to "restore" breaks at a location that were
  transformed into virtual shipments by `transform_breaks`. For each break at
  a location, it does the following:
  - creates a break request with the corresponding time window and min duration,
  - creates a route break entry with the corresponding start time and duration,
  - keeps the virtual shipment in the response, but sets its visit duration to
    zero so that all invariants about durations and start times in the solution
    still hold.
  - updates route metrics and overall solution metrics.

  Args:
    model: The model in which the transformation is done. Modified in place.
    response: The response in which the transformation is done. Modified in
      place.
    break_shipment_indices: Indices of shipments that were created as virtual
      shipments for breaks at a location. Only these shipments are transformed
      by the function. The collection should support efficient lookup, e.g. be a
