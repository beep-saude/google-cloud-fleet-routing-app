"""Takes a CFR JSON request + response and recomputes costs and other details.

A command-line utility that computes the costs and other metrics of a CFR JSON
response for a given request. Only the sequence of visits is used from the
response, the rest (timing, costs, metrics, ...) is recomputed/filled in from
scratch.

This tool is useful for what-if analysis, and to test the cost of alternative
solutions.

Typical usage:
  python3 -m cfr.json.evaluate_solution \
    --project "${YOUR_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID}" \
    --token "${YOUR_GCLOUD_TOKEN}" \
    --input_request scenario.json \
    --input_response alternative_solution.json \
    --output_response alternative_solution_with_costs.json

  Creates a new request that, when passed through the CFR API, takes the visit

  distances, durations, and costs.

  Changes made by the transformation:
  1. Remove all shipments that are skipped in `response.routes`.

  3. Set search mode to "RETURN_FAST" to make the solver return as soon as
